# Algorithm Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **`Algo.ipynb`**, which focuses on implementing and analyzing algorithms. It is designed to serve as a resource for learning, experimentation, and optimization of various algorithmic techniques.

## Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Step-by-step implementations of algorithms.
- **Code Annotations**: Detailed explanations accompanying the code cells.
- **Applications**: Examples of real-world use cases of the algorithms.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt` or as per notebook instructions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rudrapratap16/Trend-detection
   cd ./Trend-detection
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Algo.ipynb
   ```
## Usage Instructions
The project processes historical stock market data (`Nifty 50_ONE_DAY.csv`) to calculate technical indicators and trends.

### The main algorithm:
1. **Technical Indicators**: Calculates ATR, RSI, and moving averages (MA40, MA80, MA160).
2. **Trend Classification**: Uses a custom function (`mytarget`) to classify trends based on predefined thresholds:
   - **1**: Downtrend
   - **2**: Uptrend
   - **0**: No clear trend.
3. **Data Splitting**: Splits the data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
4. **Model Training**: Trains the **KNN** model and evaluates its accuracy on the test data.
5. **Outputs**:
   - Training accuracy.
   - Testing accuracy.
   - Benchmark accuracy using a random model.

## Project Design and Insights

### Why These Indicators?
- **ATR**: Measures volatility and helps set realistic stop-loss values.
- **RSI**: Indicates overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Moving Averages**: Smooth out price data to identify trend direction.

### Challenges Faced:
- Balancing the dataset for fair model evaluation.
- Selecting the optimal number of neighbors (`k`) for KNN.
- Fine-tuning thresholds in the `mytarget` function.

### Key Insights:
- KNN performs better than a random model but has scope for improvement.
- Feature engineering, such as additional technical indicators, could enhance performance.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional datasets and indices.
- Experiment with other machine learning models like Decision Trees or Neural Networks.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for `k` in KNN to find the optimal value.
- Create a visualization dashboard for model predictions and trends.
- Explore feature scaling techniques to improve model accuracy.
